This is a Pathfinding Visualizer built using Python and Pygame. <br>
It demonstrates the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from a start node to a target node in a grid.<br>
The visualizer allows users to add walls, set the start and end points, and observe how DFS traverses the grid to find a path.<br>
Features of this project are : <br>
1. Interactive grid for adding/removing walls and setting start and target nodes.<br>
2. Visualization of the DFS pathfinding algorithm, showing the steps it takes to reach the goal.<br>
3. Simple UI for a seamless user experience.
